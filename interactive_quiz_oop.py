# Create a quiz game using classes to organize questions and track scores

# Create a class called question. That is going to be a class. You¬¥re going to then create instances
# of which are going to be all the questions for the quiz game, and this question class is then
# going to include properties for the prompt which is going to be the question as well as the
# anwer, so what is the correct answer for this question.
# Then we¬¥re going to create a second class called quiz, this is going to include a property called
# questions which is going to be a list of objects of this class question that we defined before,
# and then it¬¥s going to include a second property called score which is supposed to iniatilize as
# zero and then increment as you run through the game.
